Title: Is it me against myself?

	I feel like someone else
'Cause I can't find my way back home
And I don't wanna do it alone
Is it me against myself
And everybody else?
'Cause I can't fix this on my own
I don't wanna do it alone
Had a talk with myself
Try to smile and wish me well
Feel like I'm a broken shell
Hard to lie when you're overwhelmed
It still hurts when you're already numb
Every walk becomes a run
It's gettin' hard to hold on
When you come undone
'Cause lately everything around keeps changing
I've been thinking that maybe
Maybe I'm to blame
Maybe we're both the same
Is it me against myself?
I feel like someone else
'Cause I can't find my way back home
And I don't wanna do it alone
Is it me against myself
And everybody else?
'Cause I can't fix this on my own
And I don't wanna do it alone
No, I don't wanna do it alone
(Alone, alone)
It's hard to look back
When you have to face the facts
That the person that I was
Isn't coming back
'Cause lately everything around keeps changing
I've been thinking that maybe
Maybe I'm to blame
Maybe we're both the same (both the same)
Is it me against myself?
I feel like someone else
'Cause I can't find my way back home
And I don't wanna do it alone
Is it me against myself
And everybody else?
'Cause I can't fix this on my own
And I don't wanna do it alone
No, I don't wanna do it alone
(Alone, alone)
Lately everything around keeps changing
I've been thinking that maybe
Maybe I'm to blame
Maybe we're both the same (both the same)
Lately everything around keeps changing
